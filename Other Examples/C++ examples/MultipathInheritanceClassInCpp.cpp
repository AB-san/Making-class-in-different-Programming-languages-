/* Problem Statement
A school is looking at automating the result processing for their students. Every student is identified with a roll number. The result is calculated by taking the test marks
of the subjects â€“ English, Science and Math,along with his score in sports. Write a program to calculate the result (percentage scored) of 5 students using array of objects.
Create separate classes for Student, Test Marks, Sport Marks and Result with appropriate members. Inherit the Test Marks and Sports Marks class from the Student class and the
Result class from the Test Marks and Sport Marks classes. Write separate member functions for accepting the Student roll number and marks from the user. Also design the
inheritance diagram for the above. 
 Note: The members should be encapsulated well and the member functions of the class should not be inline.*/


/* using Multipath inheritence we can inherit the class student in both test_mark class and sport_score class.And the virtual base class will prevent the duplication of data 
member in both classes.*/
