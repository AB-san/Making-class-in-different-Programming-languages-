 Making Class in different programming languages is an attempt to make available the way of constructing classes in different languages in a centralizes repo.

##### [Note: Avoid conflict in language. If you are using the same language, try to construct the class in a different manner]

# Steps to follow
### Step 1: Make a Class named Vehicle with the attributes price, color and model. 
### Step 2: Make an object car1 with a price 500$, color as Red and model as 008x5
### Step 3: Now output the details of the object attributes
### Step 4: You are done content wise, now name the file as ClassIn<langauge name><version (optional)>.<langauge_extension> 

##### <i> For easy reference, look up ClassInPython.py for naming and content <i>
